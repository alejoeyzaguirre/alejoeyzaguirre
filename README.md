- Hi, I’m @alejoeyzaguirre and I'm currently an econ student at PUC de Chile.
- I’m interested in economics (micro, IO) and data science. 
- I’m currently working as a Data Scientist at ConsiliumBots and also once in a while I try to program some things.
- I’m looking to collaborate on the economics field to maximize everyones welfare.
- For any question just ask me by email (jeeyzaguirre@uc.cl).
