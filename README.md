## Hi ✌️!
- I’m @alejoeyzaguirre and I'm currently an Econ student 📈 at PUC de Chile.
- I’m interested in Economics (econometrics and IO) and Data Science. 
- I’m currently working on my Master in Economics Thesis where I study the impact of social media on the economy.
- Previously I worked as a Research Assistant for Prof. Emilio Depetris-Chauvin, as a Data Scientist at ConsiliumBots, and as a Research Analyst at Compass Lexecon. 
- Once in a while I try to program some things (Python, Matlab, Stata and R).
- I’m looking to collaborate in the economics field to maximize everyones welfare 🌎 🌍 🌏.
- For any question just ask me by email (alejo@uc.cl).
