## Hi ✌️!
- I’m @alejoeyzaguirre and I'm currently an Econ student 📈 at PUC de Chile.
- I’m interested in Economics (micro, econometrics and IO) and Data Science. 
- I’m currently working as a Research Assistant for Prof. Emilio Depetris-Chauvin and also once in a while I try to program some things (Python, Stata and R). Previously I worked as a Data Scientist at ConsiliumBots and at Compass Lexecon as a Research Analyst.
- I’m looking to collaborate in the economics field to maximize everyones welfare 🌎 🌍 🌏.
- For any question just ask me by email (alejo@uc.cl).
